    <p> Unless something else did exist.</p>
    <p> It could be possible.</p>
    <p> Just like how you thought that you got a bad ending, but you didn't.</p>
    <p> Anything could be possible. </p>
    <p> Just like a gorrila being behind you right now.</p>
    <p> It's not likely, but it's not 0% likely going to happen either.</p>
<p> There could also be a dinosuar behind you as well, but it has an EXTREMELY low likelyhood of happening.</p>
<p> But it's not 0%!</p>
<p> What I'm saying is that whatever you do, it can work.</p>
<p> But it might not have a high chance of working.</p>
