    <p> You press the past button. </p>
<p> Suddenly, everything around you vanishes, and is replaced by a very medieval looking area.</p>
<p> Suddenly, a medieval looking knight comes right for you. </p>
<p> You then remember that you HAVE A DEAD BODY in your time machine, which probably got the knight to start running to you. </p>
<p> He's probably gonna kill you, so what do you do? </p>
