    <p> You press the lengthy looking button.</p>
    <p> Suddenly, you are teleported to the time machine parking.</p>
    <p> It's nighttime, which is weird because when you entered the police station, it was daytime.</p>
    <p> The police see you. </p>
    <p> The time machine you took is warming up.</p>
    <p> Luckily, you see the time machine you used to get here.</p>
<p> You jump inside and return to the present.</p>
