    <p> The sheets of paper are money!</p>
    <p> You try to take the backpack, but it's stuck. </p>
<p> Then you realize that the money is going to get stuck too if you don't take it out.</p>
<p> You immediately reach in his backpack and begin pulling out money as fast as you can.</p>
<p> The glue hardens an hour later.</p>
<p> But you've pulled out 1543 hundred dollar bills before it does.</p>
<p> So now you have $154,300 and a dead body in a time machine.</p>
<p> Wait... Dead body... In a time machine...</p>
<p> Wasn't that the time machine that you used to get here in the first place?</p>
