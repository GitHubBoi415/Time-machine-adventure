    <p> You enter the court.</p>
<p> As usual in this futuristic world, the court looks futuristic.</p>
<p> Then a futuristic judge comes along </p>
<p> He says "you are charged with having a dead body, what is your excuse?" </p>
<p> This is not how courts are supposed to work, but it's the future, after all. What do you say? </p>
