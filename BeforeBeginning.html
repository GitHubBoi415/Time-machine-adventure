    <p> Then you awaken.</p>
<p> You look around.</p>
<p> You had a really strange dream!</p>
<p> The internet is down.</p>
<p> There's nothing to do. </p>
<p> So you look for a board game. </p>
<p> Then you find a game you have never read before.</p>
<p> You don't remember buying this, either.</p>
<p> How did it get here?</p>
<p> You don't know.</p>
<p> You decide to play it.</p>
