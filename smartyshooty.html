    <p>You pretend to surrender.</p>
<p> The police, thinking you actually have surrendered, lower their gaurd and try to bring you to prision.</p>
<p> And then you immediately shotgun them all.</p>
<p> The police, taken completely by suprise, are no match for your shotgun.</p>
<p> They all either get shot down or run away.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, you have run out of shotgun shells.</p>
<p> But the police station is completely empty!</p>
