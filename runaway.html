    <p> You don't think the time machine will get you away from the knight quickly enough. </p>
<p> So you ditch the time machine and run away from the knight. </p>
<p> He should have caught up to you, but his armor slowed him down.</p>
<p> You hide behind a tree and hope the knight won't find you.</p>
<p> Then you hear his footsteps coming right for you!</p>
<p> Your only hope is to fight back, but what can you do?</p>
