    <p>You walk up to the guards.</p>
<p> "HALT! WHO GOES THERE!" One of them yells.</p>
<p> "I do," you say, before burning them all to a crisp.</p>
<p> Well, you got past them.</p>
<p> You walk into the castle.</p>
<p> And then you realize there are a LOT of knights.</p>
<p> And they all saw you burn the guards.</p>
<p> They all charge at you.</p>
<p> You ready your flamethrower, but can you handle all the knights?</p>
