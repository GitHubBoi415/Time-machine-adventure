    <p> You decide to burn everything and be hailed as a god because of your powers.</p>
    <p> You walk up to the nearest castle.</p>
    <p> Two guards say "HALT! WHO GOES THE-"</p>
    <p> And then you burn them. And everything else, really.</p>
<p> But as you are doing that, a portal appears behind you.</p>
<p> A person walks out, and makes the following statement:</p>
<p> "STOP! You are disrupting the timeline. As a time police, I must now kill you."</p>
<p> What do you do? </p>
