    <p>You start burning everything.</p>
<p> The knights are unable to stop you. The fire is too much.</p>
<p> Then the castle starts getting really hot.</p>
<p> Fires spread everywhere.</p>
<p> The castle is ruined.</p>
<p> Everyone is either already dead or escaped outside.</p>
<p> Except you.</p>
<p> You are stuck inside.</p>
<p> But then, a portal appears behind you.</p>
<p> A person walks out, and makes the following statement:</p>
<p> "STOP! You have disrupted the timeline. As a time police, I must now kill you."</p>
<p> What do you do? </p>
