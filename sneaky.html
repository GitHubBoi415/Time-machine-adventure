    <p> You get the knights armor suited on you.</p>
    <p> You hope no one will see your face through the mask and walk to the castle.</p>
    <p> "HALT! WHO GOES- Oh! It's you." Says one of the gaurds.</p>
    <p> You nod.</p>
    <p> "You may pass," He says, and walks to the side.</p>
    <p> You enter.</p>

    <p> Inside, there are many knights.</p>
    <p> No one has noticed anything odd about you yet.</p>
