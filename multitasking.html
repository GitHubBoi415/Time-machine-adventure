    <p> You try to burn the man while running backwards with a flamethrower.</p>
<p> But since you can't see where you are going, you trip and fall.</p>
<p> He then grabs your leg and drags you into the portal from where he came from, and brings you into what looks like a futuristic prision.</p>
<p> Then he just leaves you in there.</p>
