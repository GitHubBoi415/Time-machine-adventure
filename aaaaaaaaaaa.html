    <p> You shoot the shopkeeper.</p>
<p> He doesn't stand a chance against you.</p>
<p> Then you head outside and are surrounded by police cars.</p>
<p> Good thing you stole his shotgun shells!</p>
<p> You shoot all the police cars down and run away as fast as you can.</p>
<p> Then you find two paths.</p>
<p> To the left is the time machine parking, and to the right is the police station.</p>
<p> Which way will you go?</p>
