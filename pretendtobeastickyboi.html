    <p> You make a makeshift crown, and try to look like a king.</p>
    <p> Then you stride to the castle.</p>
    <p> "HALT! WHO GOES THERE!" Shouts one of the guards.</p>
    <p> "It is I, the king!" You reply.</p>
    <p> They look at you oddly.</p>
    <p> Then they laugh.</p>
    <p> "No, you aern't!" The guard says.</p>
    <p> They make you go away, and they continue to laugh.</p>
    <p> Well that didn't work. But what else could you do?</p>
