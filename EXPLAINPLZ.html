    <p> Suddenly, you remember that this is all just a game.</p>
    <p> A game you play for fun.</p>
    <p> It doesn't have to make any sense, but it has to be fun to play.</p>
    <p> And although this is nonsensical, it sure is fun.</p>
    <p> But do you think it is?</p>

<div class = "links"> 
    <a href ="Tisepic.html"><p> It's fun!</p></a>
    <a href ="FAILURETOENJOY.html"><p> No, it's not.</p></a>
