    <p> You decide to watch what happens instead.</p>
    <p> Someone walks to the guy with the backpack. </p>
<p> He says "You destroyed the banks. Now I'm going to destroy you."</p>
<p> Then he shoots him.</p>
<p> And leaves.</p>
<p> Once you are sure that he is gone, you slowly walk to the time machine.</p>
<p> You look at the dead body.</p>
<p> And you look inside his backpack.</p>
<p> Then you feel weird, small sheets of paper.</p>
<p> You pull them out.</p>
