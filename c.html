    <p> You take enough coins to make a small fortune when you return, but not enough to weigh you down.</p>
    <p> When you walk out of the castle, no one notices.</p>
    <p> Then someone does. </p>
    <p> Everyone tries to get you, but you are already at the time machine.</p>
    <p> You escape to the present.</p>
    <p> You look in your pockets.</p>
    <p> You got out with 78 coins!</p>
    <p> And they were all made of gold.</p>
    <p> Awesome!</p>
<p> YOU GOT THE "STOLEN MONEY" ENDING</p>
