    <p>You walk up to the guards.</p>
<p> "HALT! WHO GOES THERE!" One of them yells.</p>
<p> You ask them "Can I enter?"</p>
<p> The guard replies "Why should I let you in?"</p>
<p> So you give him the armor of the knights.</p>
<p> "Wait, isn't that..." He pauses.</p>

<p> "YOU KILLED THEM!!!" They exclaim in horror.</p>
<p> And then they kill you.</p>
<p> YOU GOT THE "WRONG BRIBE" ENDING</p>
